This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Overview
---------
This project is a frontend application that mimics the functionality of a traditional spreadsheet. Built with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS, the application includes core spreadsheet features, advanced functionalities, and a user-friendly interface. The project uses zustand for state management to handle the grid data efficiently.

Features
----------
Core Functionality:

Grid Rendering: Displays a grid of 1000 blank cells.
Cell Editing: Allows users to edit cell content dynamically.
Data Storage: Manages cell data in memory with persistent state.
Cell Styling: Features clear grid lines, padding, and font styles.

Advanced Features:
--------------------
Cell Formatting: Basic formatting options like text alignment and font size adjustments.

Data Validation: Restricts cells to numeric values or specific text formats.

Search and Filter: Enables quick data location within the grid.

Pagination: Implements pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.

Undo/Redo: Provides functionality to revert changes made to cells.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (>= 14.x)
npm 
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository

cd spreadsheet-app
Install Dependencies

Using npm:

Copy code
npm install

Using npm:

run:
npm run dev

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Navigating the Grid: Scroll to navigate through the 1000 cells in the grid.
Editing Cells: Click on a cell to enter edit mode and type the desired content.
Formatting Cells: Use the formatting toolbar to adjust text alignment and font size.
Search and Filter: Use the search bar to locate specific data within the grid.
